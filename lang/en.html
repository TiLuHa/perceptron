    Welcome to <b>Perceptron</b>!
</p>


<p id="00_content_0">
    You often hear about the various problems that are solved with neural networks:
    image recognition, chess computers, speech recognition, and much more.<br>
    <br>
    But how does a neural network actually work?<br>
    Is it really structured like the human brain?<br>
    Will we soon no longer need programmers?<br>
    <br>
    We want to understand the neural network together with you.
    What is it made of, what tasks can it solve, and what tasks it cannot solve...

    <b>Howdy, Jochen!</b>
</p>

<p id="01_text1">
    This is Jochen, the pear farmer.<br>
    He sells pear cake, pear jam, and pear beer.<br>
    The main thing is that there are pears in them.
</p>

<p id="01_text2">
    Jochen always chooses exactly the right pears for each of his products.<br>
    To show us that, Jochen has prepared something...
</p>

<p id="01_text3">
    Jochen sorts his pears on a large surface.<br>
    The green pears go all the way to the left,<br>
    and the yellow ones go all the way to the right.
</p>

<p id="01_text4">
    He puts the particularly large pears at the top.<br>
    The smaller ones go towards the bottom.
</p>

<p id="01_text5">
    The slightly yellowish pears are especially needed for the jam.
</p>

<p id="01_text6">
    For the pear cake, which is actually a pear roll,<br>
    Jochen only uses particularly large and small pears.
</p>

<p id="01_text7">
    For the pear beer, he needs all the slightly greenish<br>
    and medium-sized yellowish pears.
</p>

<p id="01_text8">
    Jochen can determine which product each pear is suitable for.
</p>

<p id="01_step0">
    Jam<br>
    or beer!
</p>

<p id="01_step1">
    Cake<br>
    or beer!
</p>

<p id="01_step2">
    Cake!
</p>

<p id="01_ehm">
    Um...
</p>

<p id="01_text9">
    Jochen is super exhausted from all the sorting.<br>
    It takes him a lot of time to sort all the pears.
</p>

<p id="01_platt">
    I'm exhausted.
</p>

<p id="01_text10">
    Jochen's daughter Maja sees how tired her father is and wants to help him. <br>
</p>

<p id="01_text11">
    She studies computer science and has just learned<br>
    how neural networks work. She thinks that's exactly what Jochen needs.<br>
    Jochen doesn't know what it is, but he agrees anyway.
</p>

<p id="01_text12">
    Maja immediately gets to work and builds a prototype.<br>
    Jochen is happy to have his daughter's help.
</p>

<p id="01_tschau">
    Good luck!
</p>

<p id="01_text13">
    While Maja is working on the neural network, Jochen wonders<br>
    what it might look like...
</p>
<p id="01_text14">
    Oh, it seems Maja has already created the first prototype!
</p>
<p id="02_title">
    <b>This is the simplest neural network that exists.</b>
</p>
<p id="02_text1">
    Maja hands her father the tablet.<br>
    She has developed an app that determines whether a pear is suitable for a specific product.<br>
    The app just needs to be properly configured.

<p id="02_text2">
    First, Jochen needs to take a photo of a pear.<br>
</p>
<p id="02_text4">
    The program has captured the pear and displays the pear's values.<br>.
</p>
<p id="02_text5">
    The color is stored as a number from -5 to 5.<br>
    A value of -5 means the pear is completely green, and<br>
    a value of 5 means the pear is completely orange.
</p>
<p id="input1_description">
    <span class="inputText">Color</span>
</p>
<p id="input2_description">
    <span class="inputText">Size</span>
</p>
<p id="02_text6">
    The size is also stored as a number between -5 and 5.<br>
    Pears with a size of -5 are the smallest, and those with 5 are the largest.
</p>
<p id="02_text7">
    This pear is very suitable for jam.<br>
    Let's see if the neural network recognizes that as well.<br>
</p>
<p id="02_scannerText">
    Please take a photo<br>
    of a pear.
</p>
<p id="02_geeigentText">
    Suitable for jam:
</p>
<p id="02_text8">
    The neural network did NOT recognize<br>
    that it is a jam pear.<br>
    That means we still need to adjust it correctly!<br>
</p>
<p id="02_text9">
    This is the neural network. It consists of a single <span class="perceptronText"><b>perceptron</b></span>.<br>
    You can think of a perceptron as a cell in the brain.<br>
    So, this brain has only one cell... ;)
</p>
<p id="02_text10">
    The perceptron is connected to the inputs.<br>
    These connections are called <span class="gewichteText"><b>weights</b></span>.<br>
    It also has a <span class="biasText"><b>bias</b></span>.<br>
</p>
<p id="02_text11">
    Drag the gray sliders until a checkmark appears.<br>
    You can use your fingers or your mouse depending on your device.<br>
    You can also move your mouse over the slider and<br>
    <b>rotate the mouse wheel</b>.
</p>
<p id="02_text12">
    Very good. You have found a setting where<br>
    the neural network correctly evaluates the pear.<br>
    But how does the neural network calculate the result?
</p>
<p id="02_text13">
    First, the perceptron calculates its <span class="potenzialText">potential</span>.<br>
    The inputs are multiplied by the weights:<br>
    <span class="inputText">Color</span> &#183 <span class="gewichteText">Weight</span> + <span class="inputText">Size</span>
    &#183 <span class="gewichteText">Weight</span> = <span class="potenzialText">Potential</span><br>

    <b>All at Once</b>
</p>

<p id="03_text1">
    The network is now only properly adjusted for a single pear.<br>
    However, Jochen wants ALL the pears to be sorted correctly.<br>
    The adjustment must work for all pears.
</p>
<p id="03_text2">
    Jochen lays out all the pears in front of him again.<br>
    The highlighted pears are the jam pears.<br>
</p>
<p id="03_text3">
    Jochen opens the neural network and wants to check all the pears.<br>
    All pears with a checkmark are recognized as jam pears.
    However, some are still sorted incorrectly.<br>
</p>
<p id="03_text4">
</p>
<p id="03_text5">
    Adjust the setting of the neural network so that only the highlighted pears have a checkmark.<br>
    The transparent pears should not have a checkmark.
</p>

<p id="03_text6">
    Jochen is thrilled!<br>
    The neural network is now adjusted to correctly recognize all the jam pears.
</p>

<p id="04_title">
    <b>The Limits of a Perceptron</b>
</p>
<p id="04_text1">
    Jochen wonders if he can adjust the neural network correctly for the cake pears as well.<br>
    Is it possible to adjust the neural network correctly for the cake pears?
</p>
<p id="04_text1b">
    It seems that the neural network cannot be properly adjusted.<br>
</p>
<p id="04_text2">
    Jochen tells his daughter that the neural network can sort the jam pears correctly, but not the cake pears.
</p>
<p id="04_text3">
    Maja immediately understands what the problem is:<br>
    A single perceptron is not enough. The neural network is too small to sort the cake pears.
</p>
<p id="04_text4">
    Maja takes the tablet back.
    She programs a neural network that consists of more than one perceptron. <br>
    This way, it can be used for more complex selection processes.
</p>
<p id="04_text5">
    While Maja is programming, she explains:<br>
    A perceptron divides an area into two parts. Like with a ruler. <br>
    When we use multiple perceptrons, we can draw multiple lines. This allows us to more precisely determine which pears
    are selected.
</p>

</p>

<p id="05_text1">
    Maja has finished the new version and hands the tablet back to Jochen.<br>
    She shows him the new neural network.
</p>

<p id="05_text2">
    Jochen nearly falls off his pear boots when he sees this monster.<br>
    There are so many sliders. Can it even be adjusted?
</p>

<p id="05_text3">
    Jochen stops listening and tries his luck.<br>
    Trying is known to be better than studying.<br>
    Help him find the right setting.
</p>

<p id="06_title">
    <b>Self-Learning</b>
</p>

<p id="06_text1">
    Adjusting the neural network is almost impossible!<br>
    So, for the pear beer, Jochen definitely won't adjust the neural network by hand again. Isn't there another solution?<br>
</p>

<p id="06_text2">
    His daughter Maja reassures him. The weights and thresholds are actually never set manually, as you can't predict their
    impact.
</p>

<p id="06_text3">
    The neural network can teach itself the appropriate weights, almost entirely without human help.<br>
    You just have to tell it which pears are incorrectly assigned.
</p>

<p id="06_text4">
    Jochen lays out the beer pears and lets the neural network examine them.<br>
    Once again, many are sorted incorrectly.
</p>

<p id="06_text5">
    Click on a pear that is sorted incorrectly<br>
    and click on <i>Pear sorted incorrectly</i>.<br>
    Do you see how the neural network changes?
</p>
<p id="06_text6">
    The neural network adjusts the weights and thresholds itself.<br>
    You can also let this process run automatically. A random pear is selected and checked whether it is already sorted
    correctly.
    You just need a little patience...

<p id="07_title">
    <b>Summary</b>
</p>

<p id="07_text1">
    Jochen is incredibly excited.<br>
    From now on, he doesn't have to sort the pears himself anymore.<br>
</p>

<p id="07_text2">
    Jochen has many more ideas for pear products.<br>
    As far as he understands, he can simply show the neural network which pears are suitable for a new product. The rest, it
    will learn on its own.
</p>
<p id="07_text3">
    Maja confirms this. You just have to experiment to determine how large the network needs to be.<br>
    As a rule of thumb:
    The more complex the selection process, the larger the neural network needs to be.
</p>

<p id="07_text4">
    Together with his daughter, he now plans to build a conveyor belt so that the pears can be automatically photographed and sorted.
    But that's another story.

<p id="intro">
    Welcome to <b>Perceptron</b>!<br>
    <br>
    We often hear about the various problems that can be solved with neural networks: image recognition, chess computers,
    speech recognition, and much more.<br>
    <br>
    But how does a neural network actually work? Is it really structured like the human brain? Will we no longer need programmers
    in the future?<br>
    <br>
    We will show you the basic building block of every neural network: the <b>perceptron</b> - the smallest cell of a neural network.<br>
    <br>
    You will see that neural networks are not as complicated as they may seem and get an idea of what tasks can be solved with
    a neural network and which ones cannot.<br>

<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

<p id="conclusion_0">
    What have we learned from Jochen's pear sorting problem?
</p>
<p id="conclusion_1_a">
    1. Simple Building Blocks
</p>
<p id="conclusion_1_a2">
    The basic building blocks of every neural network are perceptrons, which perform simple mathematical calculations.
    The weights and thresholds determine the results.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_2_a">
    2. Unintelligible Inner Workings
</p>
<p id="conclusion_2_a2">
    Knowing the weights and thresholds of a neural network is of no use to a human.
    With this information alone, we cannot predict how a neural network will behave.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_3_a">
    3. Self-learning Networks
</p>
<p id="conclusion_3_a2">
    If we provide a neural network with enough example data, it can learn on its own to correctly recognize and classify these
    datasets.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_4">
    So, neural networks are not <i>real</i> brains that can completely replace the work of programmers.
    However, they can learn to make decisions like humans do, and sometimes even better.
</p>
<p id="conclusion_btn">
    Continue
</p>

<p id="outro_1">
    There is still much more to tell,<br>
    <br>
    for example about neural networks that are even<br> superior to humans, like Google's chess AI AlphaZero.<br>
    It is not possible to create such a successful chess AI<br>
    using conventional methods!
    <br><br>
    Or we could talk about the many technical details<br>
    that make it not so easy to teach a neural network something.
    <br>
    But there are also many other great websites with exciting<br>
    visual material. For example, the <i>TensorFlow Playground</i>.<br>
    Feel free to visit the <i>TensorFlow Playground</i>, create your own<br>
    neural network, and apply what you have learned here.
